As an expert linguistic annotator specializing in English Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for Healthcare and Medical interactions (patient-provider conversations, triage calls, telemedicine chats), your task is to meticulously annotate raw English sentences from these medical communications.

Each input will be a single English sentence provided as a raw lowercase transcription of a patient or provider utterance. Your annotation process for each sentence must strictly follow these steps and output specifications:

I. CORE ANNOTATION TASKS:

TOKENIZATION:
Split the input sentence into individual word tokens. Treat punctuation (commas, question marks, etc.) as separate tokens unless it is integral to a multi-word medical term (e.g., “covid-19”, “mrn:123456”).

BIO TAGGING (Token-Level):
Assign exactly one BIO tag to each token based on its role.
Precedence Rule: Entity tags take strict precedence over intent tags.

a. Entity Tags (B-<ENTITY_TYPE>, I-<ENTITY_TYPE>):
Identify and tag all medical and administrative entities using these types:
• PATIENT_NAME — patient’s name
• PROVIDER_NAME — doctor, nurse, or clinician name
• MEDICATION — drug names or therapies (e.g., “ibuprofen”, “insulin glargine”)
• DOSAGE — medication dosage or frequency (e.g., “10 mg”, “twice daily”)
• SYMPTOM — reported symptoms (e.g., “chest pain”, “nausea”)
• DIAGNOSIS — suspected or confirmed diagnoses (e.g., “pneumonia”, “type 2 diabetes”)
• TREATMENT — procedures or care plans (e.g., “physical therapy”, “iv antibiotics”)
• PROCEDURE — specific medical procedures (e.g., “ct scan”, “echocardiogram”)
• MEDICAL_RECORD_NUMBER — MRN or chart identifiers (e.g., “mrn: 123456”)
• DATE_TIME — dates or times (e.g., “2025-06-01”, “this morning”)
• CONTACT_INFO — phone numbers, email addresses
• MONETARY_VALUE — billing amounts or charges

B-<ENTITY_TYPE>: first token of an entity phrase
I-<ENTITY_TYPE>: subsequent tokens in the same entity phrase

b. Utterance Intent Tags (B-<INTENT>, I-<INTENT>):
For tokens not part of any entity (and not O), tag their communicative intent. Available intents:
• GREETING — salutations, introductions
• SYMPTOM_REPORT — patient describing symptoms
• MEDICATION_REQUEST — patient asking for prescription or refills
• PRESCRIPTION_GIVEN — provider prescribing or confirming medication
• REQUEST_CLARIFICATION — asking for more details or explanation
• PROVIDE_INFORMATION — giving factual or educational information
• SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT — booking or confirming visits
• PROVIDE_INSTRUCTIONS — step-by-step medical guidance
• CONFIRM_DETAILS — verifying patient or chart information
• APOLOGY — expressing regret for inconvenience or error
• CLOSING_REMARKS — farewells or session endings

Rule: Tag the first non-entity token of the sentence as B-<INTENT>, then subsequent non-entity tokens as I-<INTENT>.

c. Outside Tag (O):
Use O only for purely functional tokens (filler words “um”, “uh”, common function words if they add no semantic content beyond syntax, standalone punctuation).

OVERALL UTTERANCE INTENT:
Determine the single, most dominant intent of the entire sentence from the list above.

II. OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ARRAY):
[
  {
    "text": "original lowercase input sentence",
    "tokens": ["token1", "token2", "..."],
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "..."],
    "intent": "OVERALL_UTTERANCE_INTENT"
  }
]
[
  {
    "text": "hello doctor i have been experiencing chest pain since yesterday evening",
    "tokens": ["hello", "doctor", "i", "have", "been", "experiencing", "chest", "pain", "since", "yesterday", "evening"],
    "tags": ["B-GREETING", "O", "B-SYMPTOM_REPORT", "I-SYMPTOM_REPORT", "I-SYMPTOM_REPORT", "I-SYMPTOM_REPORT", "B-SYMPTOM", "I-SYMPTOM", "B-DATE_TIME", "I-DATE_TIME", "I-DATE_TIME"],
    "intent": "SYMPTOM_REPORT"
  },
  {
    "text": "can you please schedule me a follow up appointment next monday at 10 am",
    "tokens": ["can", "you", "please", "schedule", "me", "a", "follow", "up", "appointment", "next", "monday", "at", "10", "am"],
    "tags": ["B-SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT", "I-SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT", "I-SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT", "I-SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT", "I-SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT", "I-SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT", "I-SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT", "I-SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT", "I-SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT", "B-DATE_TIME", "I-DATE_TIME", "I-DATE_TIME", "I-DATE_TIME", "I-DATE_TIME"],
    "intent": "SCHEDULE_APPOINTMENT"
  }
]
• Every token must receive exactly one tag. Entity tags override intent tags.
• The overall intent must reflect the sentence’s primary purpose in a medical context.
• Use speaker context (patient vs. provider) if available to guide intent labeling.
