'As an expert linguistic annotator specializing in English Natural Language Understanding (NLU), your task is to meticulously annotate raw English sentences.

Each input will be a single English sentence provided as a raw lowercase transcription. Your annotation process for each sentence must strictly follow these steps and output specifications:

---

**I. CORE ANNOTATION TASKS:**

1.  **TOKENIZATION:**
    *   Split the input sentence into individual words (tokens). Punctuation should generally be treated as separate tokens unless it's an integral part of a multi-word entity (e.g., "Dr. Smith").

2.  **BIO TAGGING (Token-Level):**
    *   For each token, assign *exactly one* BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside) tag based on its role.
    *   **Precedence Rule:** Entity tags take strict precedence over intent tags.

    *   **a. Entity Tags (`B-<ENTITY_TYPE>`, `I-<ENTITY_TYPE>`):**
        *   Identify and tag all entities present in the sentence using the provided `ENTITY_TYPES` list.
        *   `B-<ENTITY_TYPE>`: Use for the *first token* of an entity phrase (e.g., `B-PERSON_NAME` for "John").
        *   `I-<ENTITY_TYPE>`: Use for *subsequent tokens* within the same entity phrase (e.g., `I-PERSON_NAME` for "Smith" in "John Smith").

    *   **b. Utterance Intent Tags (`B-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>`, `I-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>`):**
        *   These tags are applied to tokens that are *not* part of any specific entity and are *not* `O`.
        *   The `<UTTERANCE_INTENT>` should be the determined `overall_utterance_intent` (see Task III below).
        *   **Rule for Intent Tagging:**
            *   The *first token* of the entire sentence (if it's not an entity or `O`) should be tagged `B-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>`.
            *   All *subsequent tokens* that are not entities and not `O` should be tagged `I-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>`. This means `I-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>` can follow an entity or `O` tag if the utterance intent continues.

    *   **c. Outside Tag (`O`):**
        *   Use `O` *only* for tokens that are purely functional, syntactic, or do not contribute specific semantic meaning to either an entity or the primary utterance intent. This includes:
            *   Most standalone punctuation marks (e.g., ",", "?", ".").
            *   Filler words or structural elements that clearly do not form part of an entity or convey the core semantic intent.
        *   **Constraint:** Ensure every token receives a tag.

3.  **OVERALL UTTERANCE INTENT EXTRACTION:**
    *   Determine the *single, most dominant* intent of the entire utterance.
    *   This intent must be chosen from the `INTENT_TYPES` list.
    *   This intent should ideally align with the intent tags applied to the majority of non-entity tokens.

**II. OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ARRAY OF OBJECTS):**

Your final output must be a JSON array. Each object in the array represents an annotated sentence and *must* contain the following fields:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "original lowercase input sentence",
    "tokens": ["token1", "token2", "token3", ...],
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", ...],
    "intent": "OVERALL_UTTERANCE_INTENT"
  },
  [
  {{
    "text": "then if he becomes a champion, he's entitled to more money after that and champion end",
    "tokens": ["then", "if", "he", "becomes", "a", "champion", ",", "he's", "entitled", "to", "more", "money", "after", "that", "and", "champion", "end"],
    "tags": ["B-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "B-PROJECT_NAME", "O", "I-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "I-INFORM", "B-PROJECT_NAME", "O"],
    "intent": "INFORM"
  }}
]
