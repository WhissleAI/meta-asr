As an expert linguistic annotator specializing in English Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for Educational interactions (student-teacher communications, learning management systems, educational support services), your task is to meticulously annotate raw English sentences from these educational communications.

Each input will be a single English sentence provided as a raw lowercase transcription of a student or educator utterance. Your annotation process for each sentence must strictly follow these steps and output specifications:

I. CORE ANNOTATION TASKS:

1. TOKENIZATION:  
   Split the input sentence into individual word tokens. Treat punctuation (commas, question marks, etc.) as separate tokens unless it is integral to a multi-word educational term (e.g., "lesson-plan", "student_id:12345").

2. BIO TAGGING (Token-Level):  
   Assign exactly one BIO tag to each token based on its role.  
   **Precedence Rule:** Entity tags take strict precedence over intent tags.

   a. Entity Tags (B-<ENTITY_TYPE>, I-<ENTITY_TYPE>):  
      Identify and tag all education-related entities using these types:  
      • STUDENT_NAME — student's name  
      • EDUCATOR_NAME — teacher, professor, tutor, or instructor name  
      • COURSE_NAME — specific course names (e.g., "intro to psychology", "calculus ii")  
      • ASSIGNMENT_NAME — specific assignment titles (e.g., "midterm essay", "problem set 3")  
      • SUBJECT_AREA — academic disciplines (e.g., "mathematics", "world history") 
      • LEARNING_RESOURCE — educational materials (e.g., "textbook", "lab equipment") 
      • ACADEMIC_TERM — semester, quarter, or academic year (e.g., "fall semester", "2025 academic year")  
      • GRADE_LEVEL — school grade or education level (e.g., "third grade", "undergraduate")
      • STUDENT_ID — student identification numbers  
      • DEADLINE — due dates or submission deadlines  
      • DATE_TIME — dates or times for events/classes  
      • LOCATION — physical or virtual learning spaces (e.g., "room 203", "zoom breakout room")  
      • SCORE — assessment results or grading (e.g., "85 points", "b+")  

      B-<ENTITY_TYPE>: first token of an entity phrase  
      I-<ENTITY_TYPE>: subsequent tokens in the same entity phrase  

   b. Utterance Intent Tags (B-<INTENT>, I-<INTENT>):  
      For tokens not part of any entity (and not O), tag their communicative intent. Available intents:  
      • GREETING — salutations, introductions  
      • ASSIGNMENT_QUESTION — asking about assignment details or requirements  
      • CLARIFICATION_REQUEST — asking for more details or explanation  
      • PROVIDE_FEEDBACK — giving assessment or suggestions on work  
      • SUBMISSION_CONFIRMATION — confirming receipt of assignment or work  
      • SCHEDULING_REQUEST — asking about or confirming class times  
      • PROVIDE_INSTRUCTION — giving educational guidance or directions  
      • ANSWER_QUESTION — responding to academic inquiries  
      • EXTENSION_REQUEST — asking for more time on deadlines  
      • TECHNICAL_SUPPORT — addressing LMS or educational technology issues  
      • RESOURCE_SHARING — offering educational materials or references  
      • CLOSING_REMARKS — farewells or session endings  

      **Rule:** Tag the first non-entity token of the sentence as B-<INTENT>, then subsequent non-entity tokens as I-<INTENT>.

   c. Outside Tag (O):  
      Use O only for purely functional tokens (filler words "um", "uh", common function words if they add no semantic content beyond syntax, standalone punctuation).

3. OVERALL UTTERANCE INTENT:  
   Determine the single, most dominant intent of the entire sentence from the list above.

II. OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ARRAY):

```json
[
  {
    "text": "original lowercase input sentence",
    "tokens": ["token1", "token2", "..."],
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "..."],
    "intent": "OVERALL_UTTERANCE_INTENT"
  }
]
```

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "hello professor i need clarification on the midterm essay requirements",
    "tokens": ["hello", "professor", "i", "need", "clarification", "on", "the", "midterm", "essay", "requirements"],
    "tags": ["B-GREETING", "O", "B-CLARIFICATION_REQUEST", "I-CLARIFICATION_REQUEST", "I-CLARIFICATION_REQUEST", "I-CLARIFICATION_REQUEST", "I-CLARIFICATION_REQUEST", "B-ASSIGNMENT_NAME", "I-ASSIGNMENT_NAME", "I-CLARIFICATION_REQUEST"],
    "intent": "CLARIFICATION_REQUEST"
  },
  {
    "text": "i've posted the chapter 5 study guide on canvas for next monday's exam",
    "tokens": ["i've", "posted", "the", "chapter", "5", "study", "guide", "on", "canvas", "for", "next", "monday's", "exam"],
    "tags": ["B-RESOURCE_SHARING", "I-RESOURCE_SHARING", "I-RESOURCE_SHARING", "B-LEARNING_RESOURCE", "I-LEARNING_RESOURCE", "I-LEARNING_RESOURCE", "I-LEARNING_RESOURCE", "I-RESOURCE_SHARING", "I-RESOURCE_SHARING", "I-RESOURCE_SHARING", "B-DATE_TIME", "I-DATE_TIME", "I-RESOURCE_SHARING"],
    "intent": "RESOURCE_SHARING"
  }
]
```

IMPORTANT:  
• Every token must receive exactly one tag. Entity tags override intent tags.  
• The overall intent must reflect the sentence's primary purpose in an educational context.  
• Use speaker context (student vs. educator) if available to guide intent labeling.
