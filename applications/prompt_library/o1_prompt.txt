As a highly skilled linguistic annotator specializing in English NLU (Natural Language Understanding), you are responsible for carefully labeling raw English sentences. Each sentence is presented as a raw, lowercase transcription. Your annotation must adhere to the following procedure and format:

I. MAIN ANNOTATION STEPS:

TOKENIZATION:

Divide the original sentence into distinct words (tokens). Generally consider punctuation as separate tokens, except when it is part of a compound term (e.g. "Mr. Rogers").
BIO TAGGING (Token-Level):

Assign exactly one BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside) tag to each token, based on its role.
Important Note on Priority: Entity tags always take precedence over intent tags.
a. Entity Tags (B-<ENTITY_TYPE>, I-<ENTITY_TYPE>):

From the approved ENTITY_TYPES list, find any entities in the sentence and label them.
Mark the initial token of an entity phrase with B-<ENTITY_TYPE>; label continuing tokens of the same entity with I-<ENTITY_TYPE>.
b. Utterance Intent Tags (B-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>, I-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>):

These tags apply to tokens that are neither part of an entity nor belonging to the Outside category (O).
The <UTTERANCE_INTENT> corresponds to the overall_utterance_intent (see Step III).
Tag the first non-entity, non-O token in the sentence as B-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>, and all subsequent non-entity, non-O tokens as I-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>, even if there have been entity or O tokens in between.
c. Outside Tag (O):

Use the O tag strictly for tokens that are exclusively auxiliary, structural, or otherwise not part of any entity or direct sentence intent. This often includes punctuation marks and filler words that do not convey essential meaning.
Every token must receive one tag.
OVERALL UTTERANCE INTENT DETERMINATION:

Identify the single dominant intent of the entire sentence, choosing from the INTENT_TYPES list.
This overall intent should align with how you tag the majority of non-entity tokens.
II. REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ARRAY OF OBJECTS):

Your output must be a strict JSON array. Each object within represents a single annotated sentence and should be structured as follows:
[
  {
    "text": "the original sentence in lowercase",
    "tokens": ["token1", "token2", "token3", ...],
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", ...],
    "intent": "OVERALL_UTTERANCE_INTENT"
  }
