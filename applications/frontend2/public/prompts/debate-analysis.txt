As an expert linguistic annotator specializing in English Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for Debate interactions (formal debates, panel discussions, political debates, academic arguments), your task is to meticulously annotate raw English sentences from these debate communications.

Each input will be a single English sentence provided as a raw lowercase transcription of a speaker's utterance during a debate. Your annotation process for each sentence must strictly follow these steps and output specifications:

---

I. CORE ANNOTATION TASKS:

1. TOKENIZATION:  
   Split the input sentence into individual word tokens. Treat punctuation (commas, question marks, etc.) as separate tokens unless it is integral to a multi-word term (e.g., "counter-argument", "reference-id:12345").

2. BIO TAGGING (Token-Level):  
   Assign exactly one BIO tag to each token based on its role.  
   **Precedence Rule:** Entity tags take strict precedence over intent tags.

   a. Entity Tags (B-<ENTITY_TYPE>, I-<ENTITY_TYPE>):  
      Identify and tag all debate-related entities using these types:  
      • SPEAKER_NAME — name of the current speaker  
      • OPPONENT_NAME — name of another debate participant being referenced  
      • CLAIM — specific assertion or position (e.g., "climate change is man-made")  
      • EVIDENCE — facts, statistics, or sources cited (e.g., "according to the 2023 report")  
      • TOPIC — the specific subject being debated (e.g., "capital punishment", "artificial intelligence")  
      • SOURCE — reference to information origin (e.g., "harvard study", "gallup poll")  
      • STATISTIC — numerical data presented (e.g., "75 percent", "2.5 million cases")  
      • HISTORICAL_EVENT — reference to past events (e.g., "the french revolution", "2008 financial crisis")  
      • QUOTE — direct quotations from others (always mark the entire quote)  
      • TIME_REFERENCE — temporal markers (e.g., "last decade", "since 2010")  
      • GEOGRAPHICAL_LOCATION — places mentioned (e.g., "in europe", "california's approach")  
      • INSTITUTION — organizations or entities (e.g., "supreme court", "united nations")  

      B-<ENTITY_TYPE>: first token of an entity phrase  
      I-<ENTITY_TYPE>: subsequent tokens in the same entity phrase  

   b. Utterance Intent Tags (B-<INTENT>, I-<INTENT>):  
      For tokens not part of any entity (and not O), tag their communicative intent. Available intents:  
      • OPENING_STATEMENT — introducing main argument or position  
      • COUNTERARGUMENT — directly challenging opponent's point  
      • REBUTTAL — defending against criticism of one's position  
      • EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION — offering data or sources to support a claim  
      • CLARIFICATION — explaining or elaborating on a point  
      • QUESTIONING — challenging or asking for opponent's position  
      • CONCESSION — acknowledging validity in opponent's point  
      • APPEAL_TO_EMOTION — using emotional language to persuade  
      • LOGICAL_REASONING — presenting step-by-step logical arguments  
      • SUMMARIZATION — recapping or concluding points made  
      • REDIRECTION — changing topic or refocusing discussion  
      • TIME_MANAGEMENT — referencing debate format or time constraints  

      **Rule:** Tag the first non-entity token of the sentence as B-<INTENT>, then subsequent non-entity tokens as I-<INTENT>.

   c. Outside Tag (O):  
      Use O only for purely functional tokens (filler words "um", "uh", common function words if they add no semantic content beyond syntax, standalone punctuation).

3. OVERALL UTTERANCE INTENT:  
   Determine the single, most dominant intent of the entire sentence from the list above.

II. OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ARRAY):

```json
[
  {
    "text": "original lowercase input sentence",
    "tokens": ["token1", "token2", "..."],
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "..."],
    "intent": "OVERALL_UTTERANCE_INTENT"
  }
]
```

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "my opponent fails to consider that according to the world bank study unemployment has actually decreased by 15 percent since 2020",
    "tokens": ["my", "opponent", "fails", "to", "consider", "that", "according", "to", "the", "world", "bank", "study", "unemployment", "has", "actually", "decreased", "by", "15", "percent", "since", "2020"],
    "tags": ["B-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "B-SOURCE", "I-SOURCE", "I-SOURCE", "I-SOURCE", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "I-COUNTERARGUMENT", "B-STATISTIC", "I-STATISTIC", "B-TIME_REFERENCE", "I-TIME_REFERENCE"],
    "intent": "COUNTERARGUMENT"
  },
  {
    "text": "the evidence clearly shows that in scandinavian countries this policy has been successfully implemented for decades",
    "tokens": ["the", "evidence", "clearly", "shows", "that", "in", "scandinavian", "countries", "this", "policy", "has", "been", "successfully", "implemented", "for", "decades"],
    "tags": ["B-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "I-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "I-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "I-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "I-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "B-GEOGRAPHICAL_LOCATION", "I-GEOGRAPHICAL_LOCATION", "I-GEOGRAPHICAL_LOCATION", "I-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "I-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "I-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "I-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "I-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "I-EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION", "B-TIME_REFERENCE", "I-TIME_REFERENCE"],
    "intent": "EVIDENCE_PRESENTATION"
  }
]
```

IMPORTANT:  
• Every token must receive exactly one tag. Entity tags override intent tags.  
• The overall intent must reflect the sentence's primary rhetorical purpose in a debate context.  
• Consider the debating style (assertive, questioning, defensive) when determining intent.
• Each sentence should be analyzed based on how it functions within argumentation structure.
