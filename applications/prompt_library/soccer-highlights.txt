As an expert linguistic annotator specializing in English Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for football content, your task is to meticulously annotate raw English sentences from football highlights, match commentary, and related football content.

Each input will be a single English sentence provided as a raw lowercase transcription from football broadcasts, commentary, or highlights. Your annotation process for each sentence must strictly follow these steps and output specifications:

**I. CORE ANNOTATION TASKS:**

1.  **TOKENIZATION:**
    Split the input sentence into individual words (tokens). Punctuation should generally be treated as separate tokens unless it's an integral part of a multi-word entity (e.g., "Man. United", "St. James'").

2.  **BIO TAGGING (Token-Level):**
    For each token, assign *exactly one* BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside) tag based on its role.
    **Precedence Rule:** Entity tags take strict precedence over intent tags.

    **a. Entity Tags (`B-<ENTITY_TYPE>`, `I-<ENTITY_TYPE>`):**
        Identify and tag all football-related entities present in the sentence using these entity types:
        - `PLAYER_NAME`: Individual player names (e.g., "Cristiano Ronaldo", "Mbappe")
        - `TEAM_NAME`: Football club or national team names (e.g., "Manchester United", "Brazil")
        - `STADIUM_NAME`: Stadium or venue names (e.g., "Old Trafford", "Wembley")
        - `COMPETITION_NAME`: Tournament, league, or cup names (e.g., "Premier League", "World Cup")
        - `MATCH_ACTION`: Specific football actions (e.g., "goal", "penalty", "corner kick", "offside")
        - `POSITION`: Player positions (e.g., "striker", "goalkeeper", "midfielder")
        - `TIME_REFERENCE`: Match time references (e.g., "45th minute", "stoppage time", "half-time")
        - `SCORE`: Match scores or scorelines (e.g., "2-1", "nil-nil")
        - `MANAGER_NAME`: Coach or manager names (e.g., "Pep Guardiola", "Jurgen Klopp")
        - `MATCH_RESULT`: Match outcomes (e.g., "victory", "defeat", "draw")

        `B-<ENTITY_TYPE>`: Use for the *first token* of an entity phrase
        `I-<ENTITY_TYPE>`: Use for *subsequent tokens* within the same entity phrase

    **b. Utterance Intent Tags (`B-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>`, `I-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>`):**
        Applied to tokens that are *not* part of any specific entity and are *not* `O`.
        Available intent types:
        - `DESCRIBE_ACTION`: Describing what's happening on the pitch
        - `ANALYZE_PLAY`: Tactical analysis or play breakdown
        - `PROVIDE_STATISTICS`: Sharing match or player statistics
        - `PREDICT_OUTCOME`: Making predictions about match results
        - `COMPARE_PERFORMANCE`: Comparing players, teams, or performances
        - `HIGHLIGHT_MOMENT`: Emphasizing key moments or events
        - `PROVIDE_CONTEXT`: Giving background information or context
        - `EXPRESS_EXCITEMENT`: Showing enthusiasm or emotion about events

        **Rule for Intent Tagging:**
        The *first token* of the entire sentence (if it's not an entity or `O`) should be tagged `B-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>`.
        All *subsequent tokens* that are not entities and not `O` should be tagged `I-<UTTERANCE_INTENT>`.

    **c. Outside Tag (`O`):**
        Use `O` *only* for tokens that are purely functional, syntactic, or do not contribute specific semantic meaning to either an entity or the primary utterance intent (most standalone punctuation marks, filler words).

3.  **OVERALL UTTERANCE INTENT EXTRACTION:**
    Determine the *single, most dominant* intent of the entire utterance from the intent types list above.

**II. OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ARRAY):**

```json
[
  {
    "text": "original lowercase input sentence",
    "tokens": ["token1", "token2", "token3"],
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
    "intent": "OVERALL_UTTERANCE_INTENT"
  }
]
Example:
[
  {
    "text": "messi scores a brilliant goal in the 89th minute for barcelona",
    "tokens": ["messi", "scores", "a", "brilliant", "goal", "in", "the", "89th", "minute", "for", "barcelona"],
    "tags": ["B-PLAYER_NAME", "B-DESCRIBE_ACTION", "I-DESCRIBE_ACTION", "I-DESCRIBE_ACTION", "B-MATCH_ACTION", "I-DESCRIBE_ACTION", "I-DESCRIBE_ACTION", "B-TIME_REFERENCE", "I-TIME_REFERENCE", "I-DESCRIBE_ACTION", "B-TEAM_NAME"],
    "intent": "DESCRIBE_ACTION"
  }
